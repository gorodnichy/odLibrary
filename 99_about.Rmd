in late years of the pandemic

In September 2022, Statistics Canada has reported the unusual increase of deaths among Canadians observed since January 2022. This App is built

### Raison d'etre

<!-- **Welcome to _Open Canada Vital Statistics Tracker_  on [OpenCanada.info](http://OpenCanada.info) portal!** -->

<!-- _Open Canada Vaccination and Vital Statistics Tracker_ (Open Canada Tracker, for short)  -->

_Open Canada [Vaccination and Vital Statistics] Tracker_ 
<!-- (full name: _Open Canada Vaccination and Vital Statistics Tracker_) -->
is the Web App that visualizes various vital and health-related statistics published by federal and provincial governments of Canada. 
Such statistics is made publicly available, however is often published in such a way that makes it difficult to use by general public. This interactive Tracker is built to address this gap.

A particular need for the development of this App came from the observation published at the [Statistics Canada's excess mortality dashboard](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2021028-eng.htm) that there have been  excess deaths observed among young Canadians following the commencement of vaccination of young population in Canada:

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220922113054/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2021028-eng.htm"> <img src="image5.png" alt="Screenshot from Statistics Canada's excess mortality dashboard" width="720" border=1 align="center"></a>

The fact that such an important observation has not been made expediently and widely known to general  public by the Canadian official media made this observation even more worrisome. 

It is hoped that this App will help to break the silence and facilitate the much needed open discussion and investigation into why there are _more_ deaths among Canadians _after_ vaccination than _before_ vaccination, in particular, among young and taking into account that covid-related deaths constitute only a fraction of the observed excess deaths.

### Help

- The App plot generates plots automatically and in real-time from the data identified in the Sources section below.
- Multiple issues with data quality and integrity may become apparent when visualized  by the App, such as those identified below. To investigate these issues in detail please see the visualization for each province separately.
- The total  value for each age may not equal the sum of values for both sexes
- The total value for all ages may not equal the sum of values for each age
- '104W SMA' designates 104-week Simple Moving Average and is the most robust metric for estimating excess deaths.
- Note that the scale is different for each age.
